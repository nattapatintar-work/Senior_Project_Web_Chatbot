"""
nlp/extract_bert.py
====================
A second, experimental text extractor for POST /extract_bert (see api/app.py),
built on a fine-tuned WangchanBERTa NER model. This is NOT used by the
production POST /extract route (nlp.extract.extract(), dictionary + fuzzy +
Trie) -- it exists so the BERT model can be tested side by side with it
before any decision to switch.

    extract_bert(text) -> {"ingredients": [...], "health_tags": [...], "excluded": []}

Same three-key contract as nlp.extract.extract() (see that module's
docstring), except "excluded" is always empty here -- see "KNOWN GAP" below.

HOW IT WORKS
------------
1. predict_entities_bert_with_confidence(text) -- ported as-is from the
   Colab notebook that trained and ablated this model (BERT overall F1
   0.902 vs. a Claude Haiku zero-shot baseline's F1 0.774). Runs the
   fine-tuned model, decodes its BIO tags into character spans, and scores
   each span's confidence as the mean per-token max-softmax probability.
2. Fallback (whole-sentence, not per-entity): if BERT finds zero entities,
   OR any entity's confidence is below label_config.json's
   confidence_threshold, the BERT result is discarded entirely and
   predict_entities_llm(text) is called instead (Claude Sonnet 5, prompt
   also ported from the same Colab notebook).

   The confidence score is a WEAK signal, verified in the ablation: mean
   confidence was 0.996 on true positives and 0.994 on false positives
   (min 0.782) -- a threshold barely separates correct predictions from
   confidently wrong ones. In practice this fallback mainly helps the
   "BERT found nothing" case; it will not reliably catch a confident wrong
   span, and the fallback should be expected to fire often, not rarely.
   That is exactly why the fallback calls Sonnet, not Haiku.
3. Whichever list won (BERT's or the LLM's), every entity's raw text is
   resolved to a canonical key via nlp.extract.resolve_token() -- the same
   exact/fuzzy synonym-index lookup nlp.extract.extract() and
   api.intent.classify_intent() already use. Neither model can invent a
   key outside data/ingredients.json / data/health_terms.json: an entity
   that doesn't resolve is dropped. The resolver's own classification
   (ingredient key vs. "health:<tag>") is trusted over the model's
   self-reported entity type, since the resolver is grounded in the
   dictionaries and the model can mislabel type.

4. apply_negation_cues(text, entities) -- a NegEx-style rule-based pass, run
   on whichever entity list won (BERT's or the LLM's), after the fallback
   decision and before resolution. For each entity it looks backward, up to
   the previous entity's end or a fixed character window (whichever is
   closer), for a negation cue substring ("ไม่เอา", "ไม่ใส่", "ไม่มี", the
   same NEGATION_VERBS nlp.extract.py's own tokenizer-based scan uses, just
   pre-combined for raw-text substring search). A matching ING entity is
   marked negated=True and routed to "excluded" instead of "ingredients".

KNOWN GAP: NEGATION DETECTION IS A RAW-TEXT HEURISTIC, NOT PARITY WITH /extract
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The label schema here is two entity types only: ING, HEALTH -- there is no
model-level negation type. apply_negation_cues() (above) covers the common
case ("ไม่เอาหมู") without retraining, but it is NOT the same mechanism as
nlp.extract.extract()'s tokenizer-based two-token scan, and two limitations
remain, both left as-is on purpose rather than silently glossed over:
  - HEALTH entities are never marked negated, even if a cue sits in their
    window -- negated health tags ("ไม่กินคีโต") are rarer and out of scope
    for this pass.
  - The cue must fall within NEGATION_CUE_WINDOW_CHARS characters of the
    entity's start (and not cross into a preceding entity's span). A cue
    further back in a long clause will be missed, unlike /extract's
    tokenizer scan, which has no such window limit.
